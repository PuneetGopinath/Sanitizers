# Contributing to BK Sanitizers !!!

Looking to contribute to BKS?
_**Here's how we can help.**_

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to BKS. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

We welcome Pull requests !!

For major changes, please open an [discussion](https://github.com/PuneetGopinath/Sanitizers/discussions) to discuss what you would like to change.

## Asking Questions

Please read [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md) for knowing where to ask questions

Don't use GitHub issues for asking questions, we use GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests.

## Using the Issue tracker

Reporting bugs and Requesting features should be done using the issue tracker

You can [Report bug](https://github.com/PuneetGopinath/Sanitizers/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) or [Request feature](https://github.com/PuneetGopinath/Sanitizers/issues/new?template=feature_request.md)

## Pull request

**Note:** Before submitting your PR, check whether your code adheres to BKS coding standards (which is mostly [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/)) by running [PHP CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer):

```
# If you downloaded from Composer:
./vendor/bin/phpcs --extensions=php --standard=PSR12 src

# Or else if you downloaded from cURL:
php phpcs.phar --extensions=php --standard=PSR12 src

# Or else if it is in the /bin or $PREFIX/bin folder
phpcs --extensions=php --standard=PSR12 src
```

Any problems can probably be fixed automatically by using its partner tool, PHP code beautifier (phpcbf):

```
# If you downloaded from Composer:
./vendor/bin/phpcbf --extensions=php --standard=PSR12 src

# Or else if you downloaded from cURL:
php phpcbf.phar --extensions=php --standard=PSR12 src

# Or else if it is in the /bin or $PREFIX/bin folder
phpcbf --extensions=php --standard=PSR12 src
```
