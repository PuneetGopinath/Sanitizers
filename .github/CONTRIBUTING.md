## Pull request

**Note:** Before submitting your PR, check whether your code adheres to BKS coding standards (which is mostly [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/)) by running [PHP CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer):

```
# If you downloaded from Composer:
./vendor/bin/phpcs

# Or else if you downloaded from cURL:
php phpcs.phar

# Or else if it is in the /bin or $PREFIX/bin folder
phpcs
```

Any problems can probably be fixed automatically by using its partner tool, PHP code beautifier (phpcbf):

```
# If you downloaded from Composer:
./vendor/bin/phpcbf

# Or else if you downloaded from cURL:
php phpcbf.phar

# Or else if it is in the /bin or $PREFIX/bin folder
phpcbf
```
