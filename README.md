<h2><a name="quick-start">Quick Start üöÄ</a></h2>

- [Download the latest version](https://github.com/PuneetGopinath/Sanitizers/archive/v1.0.1.zip)

- ### Clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/PuneetGopinath/Sanitizers.git` OR `gh repo clone PuneetGopinath/Sanitizers`

- ### What is Sanitize ??

/Ààsan…™t å…™z/ - to make something completely clean and free from bacteria.<br>

> In web development to sanitize means that you remove unsafe characters from the input.<br>
> Sanitize is a function to check (and remove) harmful data (which can harm the software) from user input.<br>
> Sanitizing user input is the most secure method of user input validation to strip out anything that is not on the whitelist.<br>

- ### When and why should I use Sanitizers ?

> Whenever you store user's data (in database or anywhere), and if that data will be read/available to (unsuspecting) users, then you have to sanitize it.<br>
> See also HTML_sanitization in
[wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_sanitization)<br>

- ### What is SQL injection

SQL injection is a method used by hackers to inject malicious SQL codes while running SQL query.

Example SQL injection in php:

for example, here `$_POST["userId"]` is `105 OR 1=1`

    $query = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = " . $_POST["userId"];
it will become:

    $query = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = 105 OR 1=1";

The SQL above is valid and will return ALL rows from the "Users" table, since `OR 1=1` is always TRUE.

Does the example above look dangerous? What if the "Users" table contains names and passwords?

- ### How can I clean user input ?

 * First, Sanitize
 * Then, Validate
 * Last, Escape output.

- ### Installation üîß

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file for Installation guide.

- ### Usage

Just include the file and Sanitize the user input.
Example Usage in php:

```php
<?php
// Import classes
use Sanitizers\Sanitizers\Sanitizer;

require "src/Sanitizers.php";

// passing `true` in Sanitize class enables exceptions
$sanitizer = new Sanitizer(true);
try {
    echo $sanitizer->sanitize("username", $_GET["username"]);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo "Could not Sanitize user input.";
    var_dump($e);
}
?>
```

Example Usage in composer:

```php
<?php
// Import classes
use Sanitizers\Sanitizers\Sanitizer;

require "vendor/autoload.php";

$sanitizer = new Sanitizer(true);
try {
    echo $sanitizer->sanitize("username", $_GET["username"]);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo "Could not Sanitize user input.";
    var_dump($e);
}
?>
```

- ### Testing with and without composer autoload in Termux (on Android)

![Gif of testing on termux](gif/BK-Sanitizers-termux.gif)

I ran:
```bash
composer validate # Validates composer.json
composer test # Test without composer autoload
composer update # Update dependencies and install autoload
composer test # Test with composer autoload
```
