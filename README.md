<h2><a name="comparing">Comparing üòï</a></h2>

#### Are you comparing BKS library with HTMLPurifier ??

Then, you need to know difference between HTMLPurifier and BKS.

1. HTMLPurifier aims at creating safe and valid HTML as close as possible to a given input. But we aim to cover sanitizing all types of input like name, username, password, etc.

But we always recomend [HTMLPurifier](https://htmlpurifier.org) for sanitizing html code.
