<h2><a name="about">About ℹ️</a></h2>

- ### What is Sanitize ??

/ˈsanɪtʌɪz/ - to make something completely clean and free from bacteria.<br>

> In web development to sanitize means that you remove unsafe characters from the input.<br>
> Sanitize is a function to check (and remove) harmful data (which can harm the software) from user input.<br>
> Sanitizing user input is the most secure method of user input validation to strip out anything that is not on the whitelist.<br>

- ### When and why should I use Sanitizers ?

> Whenever you store user's data (in database or anywhere), or if that data will be read/available to (unsuspecting) users, then you have to sanitize it.<br>
> See also HTML_sanitization in
[wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_sanitization)<br>

- ### How can I clean user input 🧹 ?

 * First, Sanitize
 * Then, Validate
 * Last, Escape output.
