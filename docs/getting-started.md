Get started with BK Sanitizers, the library for sanitizing all types of user input in PHP.

## Introduction

A Web Sanitizer is used to prevent XSS attacks. Not only Sanitizers are enough to prevent XSS, we also need to validate all sanitized user input.

Sanitization is one of the most important topic of web security or cybersecurity.

BKS is one such library for protecting your site from XSS. We aim to give you the best protection ever we can.

We try to cover all types of user input like name, username, password, messages, email, etc...

Have we missed any common type of user input? If so, please try to read the contributing guidelines and try to contribute to BK Sanitizers.

## What is XSS ??

XSS stands for Cross Site Scripting.

## What is Sanitize ??

/ˈsanɪtʌɪz/ - to make something completely clean and free from bacteria.<br>

> In web development to sanitize means that you remove unsafe characters from the input.

Sanitize is a function to check (and remove) harmful data (which can harm the software) from user input.<br>
Sanitizing user input is the most secure method of user input validation to strip out anything that is not on the whitelist.<br>

## When and why should I use Sanitizers ?

Whenever you store user's data (in database or anywhere), or if that data will be read/available to (unsuspecting) users, then you have to sanitize it.<br>
See also HTML_sanitization in
[wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_sanitization)<br>

- ### How can I clean user input ?

1. First, Sanitize
2. Then, Validate
3. Last, Escape output.

## Installation

Installation guide can be read in [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/PuneetGopinath/Sanitizers/blob/main/INSTALL.md) file.

## Starter template

A basic template for sanitizing user input with BK Sanitizers.

If you are using composer, then replace `require "src/Sanitizers.php";` with `require "vendor/autoload.php";`

```php
<?php
// Import classes
use Sanitizers\Sanitizers\Sanitizer;

require "src/Sanitizers.php";

// passing `true` in Sanitizer class enables exceptions
$sanitizer = new Sanitizer(true);
try {
    $username = $sanitizer->sanitize("username", $_GET["username"]);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo "Could not Sanitize user input.";
    echo $e->getMessage();
}
//Do anything with $username, e.g. validate it, save it to database ...
?>
```

## Steps to start using BKS

1. Loading classes

```
use Sanitizers\Sanitizers\Sanitizer;
```

 * without composer autoload:

Replace **/path/to/src/Sanitizers.php** with path to **src/Sanitizers.php** file in the code below.

```
require "/path/to/src/Sanitizers.php";
```

 * with composer autoload:

Replace **/path/to/vendor/autoload.php** with path to **vendor/autoload.php** file in the code below.

```
require "/path/to/vendor/autoload.php";
```

2. Then, Sanitize input (also add configFromIni if you want to use configuration settings from ini file).<br>

Add `$sanitizer->configFromIni("src/config.ini");` if you want to use config settings from a ini file after defining `$sanitizer` variable.

For example,<br>

```
// passing `false` in Sanitize class disables exceptions
$sanitizer = new Sanitizer(false);
$username = $sanitizer->sanitize("username", $_POST['username']);
$password = $sanitizer->sanitize("password", $_POST['password']);
```

<b>OR if you want to enable exceptions</b>

```
// passing `true` in Sanitize class enables exceptions
$sanitizer = new Sanitizer(true);

try {
    $username = $sanitizer->sanitize("username", $_POST["username"]);
    $password = $sanitizer->sanitize("password", $_POST["password"]);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo "Could not Sanitize user input.";
    var_dump($e);
}
```

If you want to sanitize arrays then use `sanitizeArray($array, $filters);`, See [FUNCTIONS.md](FUNCTIONS.md) file for understanding sanitizeArray function.

Plz read [SUPPORT.md](https://github.com/PuneetGopinath/Sanitizers/blob/main/.github/SUPPORT.md) if you want to ask questions or clarify doubts.

If you want to use `psr/log` for debugging, Then create a new logger in a variable `$logger` (e.g. `$logger = new myPsr3Logger();`), then pass the `$logger` variable in parameter #2 while constructing Sanitizer class.

You will find more to play with in the [examples](https://github.com/PuneetGopinath/Sanitizers/tree/main/examples) folder.
