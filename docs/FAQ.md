## What is Sanitize??

/ˈsanɪtʌɪz/ - to make something completely clean and free from bacteria.<br>

> In web development to sanitize means that you remove unsafe characters from the input.

Sanitize is a function to check (and remove) harmful data (which can harm the software) from user input.<br>
Sanitizing user input is the most secure method of user input validation to strip out anything that is not on the whitelist.<br>

## When and why should I use Sanitizers?

Whenever you store user's data (in database or anywhere), or if that data will be read/available to (unsuspecting) users, then you have to sanitize it.<br>

You can sanitize all the external sources before using any of them:

1. $_SERVER
2. $_POST
3. $_GET
4. $_COOKIE
5. $_REQUEST (commonly not used)
6. Data taken from databases
7. APIs
8. Input data from the clients
9. $argv
